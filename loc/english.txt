	"heist_hwu_brief":"So we've recieved information Avalon has data that could be potentially dangerous to our business. I'm not entirely sure where this information is, but I do know they have a safehouse located near one of their compounds. Infiltrate the safehouse and get me access to their network, we can't afford for this intel to leak. \nNow I'd prefer if you did this quiet, no strings attached and all that. But I'm a sucker for violence, so if you do have to make a mess of things at least make it entertaining. \n\nAgain, we're not sure what information they have, where it's at, or how to access it... so good luck!",
	"heist_Avalon's Shadow_brief":"A representative of the Kranich shipping company has hired you to retrieve sensitive information that came into posession of their rival Avalon Logistics. The exact nature and location of this information is unknown, but its been narrowed down to a warehouse on the edge of town. Conveniently, there's an Avalon safehouse right next to it that should give you easy access.\n\n»Break into the safehouse\n»Find a way inside the warehouse\n»Obtain the data\n»Escape",
	"hwu_1":"Find a laptop",
	"hwu_1_desc":"Direct entry to the warehouse is out of the question. There has to be a way to get in from this house. A laptop or something must have some helpful information",
	"hwu_1_start_sub":"Yeah, this is the place... not exactly subtle for a safehouse, but I like Avalon's style. Get inside and find a computer, I need access to the network.",
	"hwu_1_laptop_sub":"Sweet, it looks like I've got access. Let me pull up some emails and see what I can find.",
	"hwu_1_evidence_sub":"That data could come in handy. It never hurts having a little more information on your enemies.",
	"hwu_2":"Wait for the helicopter",
	"hwu_2_desc":"You're almost home free, just have to wait until the escape helicopter arrives",
	"hwu_2_usb_sub":"Ah crap, looks like they added hardware security, I didn't expect that. This email has the location of the USB key, find it so we can access those locked files.",
	"hwu_3_desc":"They've  added hardware security to the laptop Find the USB stick that will let you access them based on the clues on the hacked laptop",
	"hwu_3_usb_sub":"That's the hardware key! Plug it into the laptop and I should be able to access these files.",
	"hwu_4":"Gather info from the USB drive",
	"hwu_4_desc":"Plug the USB drive into the laptop to figure out how to get inside the warehouse",
	"hwu_4_wires_sub":"Well the good news is the warehouse can be accessed by the sewers, but the bad news is it's heavily guarded with lasers. There should be a few exposed circuit boxes in the area, check the laptop for the right wires to cut.",
	"hwu_5_desc":"Check the laptop to see which wires are connected to the security network, then cut the correct ones hidden in security boxes",
	"hwu_5_hack_sub":"Looks like they've got underground access to the warehouse. Unfortunately for us the alarms disabled that, so we're going to have to overload the system and disable the front gate. I need you to apply a code breaker to the circuit boxes, check the laptop to find the right ones.",
	"hwu_6_desc":"The sewers has been locked down, time to improvise! Hack the correct security boxes to overload the system",

	"hwu_10":"Find and enter the correct code",
	"hwu_10_desc":"There is a secret elevator that will bring you down the lower facility, but you will need to find the code to start it, go to the meeting room to see how to find it",
	"hwu_10_thermite_sub":"Damn, it looks like the alarm tripped the security measures for the elevator. We're going to need thermite to get down there, and judging from these files there should be some stored in the warehouse. Try checking some of the shipping crates.",
	"hwu_11":"Find the thermite",
	"hwu_11_elevator_sub":"Good job gang, now climb inside that container next to you, don't worry, their OSHA reports say there have only been 4 casualities with the \"hidden lift\" since it was installed... a few months ago.",
	"hwu_11_desc":"To get to the lower facility, you will need some thermite to melt the floor. There should be one in one of the small shipping crates. Find the correct one and get that thermite"
	"hwu_12_files_sub":"Oh yeah, you're probably going to need a crowbar, there should be one in the area somewhere though.",
	"hwu_12_desc":"Gather everyone inside those containers. For reasons...",
	"hwu_12_rig_sub":"About damn time! I checked their blueprints and found the perfect spot for the thermite, head over there and set it up!",
	"hwu_12":"Gather in the containers",
	"hwu_12_thermite_sub":"Thats actually kinda beautiful, let that baby do its thing, we'll be through in no time.",

	"hwu_16_security_sub":"Oh that's not good, I tripped... I mean, looks like one of you tripped the security features. Watch out for the yellow light before you make your next move.",
	"hwu_16_multiple_sub":"Oh good, the data is stored on multiple servers, looks like you're going to get your steps in today. Grab the portable server and slide it in the racks I mark for you.",
	"hwu_16_1_waiting_sub":"Looks like Avalon's got a few more dirty secrets here. I'm just gonna hold onto this for a bit.",
	"hwu_16_2_waiting_sub":"You all enjoying yourselves? Probably wouldnt hurt speeding up things just a tiny bit.",
	"hwu_16_3_waiting_sub":"Spicy! Some of this is redacted, but I think I just found a hidden facility in the mountains.",
	"hwu_16_4_waiting_sub":"Ski lifts? Wonder what Avalon ordered those for, it doesn't even snow here.",
	"hwu_16_5_waiting_sub":"Looks like we're not the only ones that Avalon has some dirt on. Might be time to make some allies.",

	"hwu_20_vent_sub":"Hey, that vent has a hidden chute in it. Toss some loot in there, and we will retrieve it later.",
	"hwu_21_vent_sub":"That's another hidden chute, make sure to secure any extra loot you find.",
	"hwu_22_vent_sub":"Nice, that might weight down the escape, but its worth it.",
	"hwu_23_vent_sub":"Well, that's where the loot would have came out if you've secured any.",
